# About Me

I've spent the last decade in the software world at startups of various sizes, wearing many hats.
Statistically, I've been programming for ~65% of the time I've been alive!

I am employed at ~~[Hasura](https://hasura.io)~~ [PromptQL](https://promptql.io/), where I build connectors for various data sources that allow users and organizations to connect their data to ~~Hasura's GraphQL engine~~ PromptQL's context engine. This work is done on the JVM, in Kotlin, using our open-source ~~[GraphQL Data Connectors](https://hasura.io/blog/hasura-graphql-data-connectors/)~~ [NDC Connectors](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/overview.html) framework. I think it's fascinating work and I'm proud to be a part of it.

# My Interests

My personal interests related to programming/software include:

- Databases/Query Engines
- Data Virtualization/Data Federation
- High-Performance/Low-Latency Systems
- Linux Kernel Memory Management and Storage internals
- The JVM

My primary programming languages are:

- TypeScript
- JVM Languages (Kotlin, Java, Scala)

Outside of programming, I have a few interests, which mostly include:

  - I use REAPER, it's a great DAW
