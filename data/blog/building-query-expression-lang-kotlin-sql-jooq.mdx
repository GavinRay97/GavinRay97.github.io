# Overview

In this post we'll walk through building a simple query expression language in Kotlin, and then using it to generate dynamic SQL. First via a simple string-producing function, then through a less fragile method via jOOQ's query DSL.

## Motivation

This sort of AST/intermediate representation of data-compute operations is useful in many situations, including:

- Creating structured/serializeable expressions that can be transfered between systems
  - See: [Substrait: Cross-Language Serialization for Relational Algebra](https://substrait.io/)
- Writing translations between query languages
- The development of query engines and their planners/optimizers

In my spare time over the past months I've had [a passion project that involves parsing GraphQL queries into an IR, and then generating + executing SQL from it.](https://github.com/GavinRay97/GraphQLCalcite)

This post is an attempt to share some of the knowledge and tips I've gained from working on that project, as well as showcase what an excellent language Kotlin is.

## Goals

What we'll ultimately be building is a program that can consume/produce a structured operation expression like the below:

```json
{
  "select": ["id", "name", "age"],
  "from": "users",
  "where": {
    "type": "EQ",
    "left": {
      "type": "COLUMN",
      "name": "name"
    },
    "right": {
      "type": "LITERAL",
      "value": "John"
    }
  },
  "groupBy": null,
  "orderBy": ["name"],
  "limit": 5,
  "offset": 2
}
```

And convert it into the corresponding SQL query:

```sql
select id, name, age
from users
where name = 'John'
order by name
offset 2 rows
fetch next 5 rows only
```

Represented as code, this expression will look like this:

```kt
Query(
    from = "users",
    select = listOf("id", "name", "age"),
    orderBy = listOf("name"),
    limit = 5,
    offset = 2,
    where = EQ(
        COLUMN("name"),
        LITERAL("John")
    )
)
```

# Architecture

The high-level architecture of the program is as follows:

- A sealed interface/algebraic data type, `Expression`, which represents the abstract syntax tree of a query `where` clause
- An interface, `ExpressionTranslator<T>` which represents a function that translates an `Expression` into a concrete value
  - A class, `SimpleStringExpressionTranslator`, which implements `ExpressionTranslator<String>`
  - A class, `jOOQExpressionTranslator`, which implements `ExpressionTranslator<org.jooq.QueryPart>`
- A class, `Query`, which contains the entirety of single query operation:
  - `select`/`from`/`where`/`group by`/`order by`/`limit`/`offset`
- An interface, `QueryTranslator` which represents a function that translates a `Query` into a concrete value
  - A class, `SimpleStringQueryTranslator`, which implements `QueryTranslator<String>`
  - A class, `jOOQQueryTranslator`, which implements `QueryTranslator<String>`

# Let's Build It

## Implementing the `Expression` AST

The below diagram shows the structure of the `Expression` interface we'll be building (with some `BinaryOperation` members omitted for size):

<img src="/static/images/kotlin-query-expression-hierarchy-diagram.svg" />

We have three _classes_ of nodes:

- `BinaryOperation`'s. These are operations that have two operands, such as `EQ`, `GT`, `LT`, etc, as well as the boolean `AND` and `OR`
- `UnaryOperation`'s. These are operations that have one operand, such as `NOT`, `IS NULL`, etc
- "Other" -- `COLUMN` and `LITERAL`, our two concrete/leaf nodes

Represented as Kotlin types, these classes look like this:

```kotlin
sealed interface Expression

sealed interface BinaryOperation : Expression {
    val operator: String
    val left: Expression
    val right: Expression
}

sealed interface UnaryOperation : Expression {
    val operator: String
    val operand: Expression
}

data class AND(override val left: Expression, override val right: Expression) : BinaryOperation {
    override val operator = "AND"
}

data class OR(override val left: Expression, override val right: Expression) : BinaryOperation {
    override val operator = "OR"
}

data class EQ(override val left: Expression, override val right: Expression) : BinaryOperation {
    override val operator = "="
}

// Let's skip the rest of the `BinaryOperation`s for brevity

data class NOT(override val operand: Expression) : UnaryOperation {
    override val operator = "NOT"
}

data class IS_NULL(override val operand: Expression) : UnaryOperation {
    override val operator = "IS NULL"
}

data class COLUMN(val name: String) : Expression

data class LITERAL(val value: Any) : Expression
```

## The `Query` object

Below will be our representation of a query:

```kotlin
data class Query(
    val select: List<String>,
    val from: String,
    val where: Expression? = null,
    val groupBy: List<String>? = null,
    val orderBy: List<String>? = null,
    val limit: Int? = null,
    val offset: Int? = null
)
```

## The `ExpressionTranslator` Interface

We need an interface/typeclass that allows us to translate an `Expression` into a concrete value.

This is the purpose of `ExpressionTranslator`:

```kotlin
interface ExpressionTranslator<T> {
    fun translate(expression: Expression): T
}
```

### A simple String translator

Now we can implement the equivalent of an "interpreter" that produces a string from an `Expression` AST.

We'll call this object `SimpleStringExpressionTranslator`, and it will implement the `ExpressionTranslator<String>` interface:

```kotlin
interface ExpressionTranslator<T> {
    fun translate(expression: Expression): T
}

object SimpleStringExpressionTranslator : ExpressionTranslator<String> {
    override fun translate(expression: Expression): String {
        return when (expression) {
            is COLUMN -> expression.name
            is LITERAL -> expression.value.toString()
            is BinaryOperation -> {
                val left = translate(expression.left)
                val right = translate(expression.right)
                "$left ${expression.operator} $right"
            }
            is UnaryOperation -> {
                val operand = translate(expression.operand)
                "${expression.operator} $operand"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

We'll combine this translator for the `where` clause of a query with a translator for the other bits of a query, to produce a complete SQL expression:

```kotlin
fun interface QueryTranslator<T> {
    fun translate(query: Query): T
}

object SimpleStringQueryTranslator : QueryTranslator<String> {
    override fun translate(query: Query): String {
        val select = query.select.joinToString(", ")
        val where = query.where?.let { SimpleStringExpressionTranslator.translate(it) }
        val groupBy = query.groupBy?.joinToString(", ")
        val orderBy = query.orderBy?.joinToString(", ")
        val limit = query.limit
        val offset = query.offset
        return """
            SELECT $select
            FROM ${query.from}
            ${where?.let { "WHERE $it" } ?: ""}
            ${groupBy?.let { "GROUP BY $it" } ?: ""}
            ${orderBy?.let { "ORDER BY $it" } ?: ""}
            ${limit?.let { "LIMIT $it" } ?: ""}
            ${offset?.let { "OFFSET $it" } ?: ""}
        """.trimIndent()
    }
}
```

### Testing the String translator

Now we can [test our simple translator in the Kotlin Playground](https://pl.kotl.in/3PgFe73wT):

```kotlin
val expression = AND(
    OR(
        EQ(
            COLUMN("name"),
            LITERAL("John")
        ),
        LT(
            COLUMN("age"),
            LITERAL(30)
        )
    ),
    NOT(
        EQ(
            COLUMN("id"),
            LITERAL(42)
        )
    )
)

val query = Query(
    from = "users",
    select = listOf("id", "name", "age"),
    orderBy = listOf("name"),
    limit = 5,
    offset = 2,
    where = expression
)

val t = SimpleStringQueryTranslator
val result = t.translate(query)
println(result)
```

The output should be:

```sql
SELECT id, name, age
FROM users
WHERE name = John OR age < 30 AND NOT id = 42
ORDER BY name
LIMIT 5
OFFSET 2
```

### The jOOQ translator

Now we'll implement the above, but using jOOQ's DSL API.

```kotlin
object jOOQExpressionTranslator : ExpressionTranslator<QueryPart> {
    override fun translate(expression: Expression): QueryPart {
        return when (expression) {
            is COLUMN -> field(name(expression.name))
            is LITERAL -> inline(expression.value)
            is BinaryOperation -> {
                val left = translate(expression.left)
                val right = translate(expression.right)
                when (expression) {
                    is AND -> and(left as Condition, right as Condition)
                    is OR -> or(left as Condition, right as Condition)
                    is EQ -> (left as Field<Any>).eq(right)
                    is NEQ -> (left as Field<Any>).ne(right)
                    is LT -> (left as Field<Any>).lt(right)
                    is LTE -> (left as Field<Any>).le(right)
                    is GT -> (left as Field<Any>).gt(right)
                    is GTE -> (left as Field<Any>).ge(right)
                    is IN -> (left as Field<Any>).`in`(right as Any)
                }
            }
            is UnaryOperation -> {
                val operand = translate(expression.operand)
                when (expression) {
                    is NOT -> not(operand as Condition)
                    is IS_NULL -> (operand as Field<Any>).isNull
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```kotlin
object jOOQQueryTranslator : QueryTranslator<String> {

    private val ctx: DSLContext = DSL.using(
        SQLDialect.POSTGRES,
        Settings()
            .withRenderFormatted(true)
            .withRenderQuotedNames(RenderQuotedNames.EXPLICIT_DEFAULT_UNQUOTED)
    )

    override fun translate(query: Query): String {
        val statement = select(query.select.map { field(name(it)) })
            .from(table(name(query.from)))
            .apply {
                query.where?.let { where(jOOQExpressionTranslator.translate(it) as Condition) }
                query.groupBy?.let { groupBy(it.map { field(name(it)) }) }
                query.orderBy?.let { orderBy(it.map { field(name(it)) }) }
                query.limit?.let { limit(inline(it)) }
                query.offset?.let { offset(inline(it)) }
            }
        return ctx.render(statement)
    }
}
```

### Testing the jOOQ translator

Unfortunately due to needing the jOOQ library, we can't test this in the Kotlin Playground.

But, I've uploaded the full working application to repl.it [that you can access here](https://replit.com/@GavinRay97/Blogpost-Building-a-Query-Expression-Language-in-Kotlin-mvn#src/main/kotlin/Application.kt):
