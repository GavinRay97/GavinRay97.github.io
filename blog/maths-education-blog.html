working in the industry for over a decade.</p><p>I&#x27;ve had the privilege of working with some extraordinarily intelligent and well-educated peers during my career.</p><p>Something I&#x27;ve often asked them about, as an &quot;outside-looking-in&quot; sort of thing, is how much they feel their maths backgrounds have contributed to their success.</p><p>Answers vary widely, but at the end of the day, I can&#x27;t help but feel like I was cheated out of an essential life skill due to general apathy and incompetence.</p><p>The story goes something like this:</p><h2 id="my-educational-history"><a href="#my-educational-history" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>My Educational History</h2><p>I am what most would consider, for the industry, &quot;woefully uneducated&quot;.</p><p>I dropped out of American public highschools at 16 to earn my GED.</p><p>This was under the misguided notion that doing so would allow me to get a jump-start on my education, begin working a real job, and finish college sooner than my peers.</p><p>In theory all of the above is possible, but it is not what happened.</p><p>I attended a local community college while working fulltime as a manual laborer, but eventually dropped out after flunking pre-requisite maths courses.</p><h2 id="the-issue-with-american-maths-education"><a href="#the-issue-with-american-maths-education" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The issue with American Maths Education</h2><p>As a personal principle, I don&#x27;t believe that victim-mentalities are conducive to success and personal growth.</p><p>That is to say, I am sure that had I been sufficiently motivated and &quot;just tried hard enough&quot;, there is a world in which I could have passed those classes.</p><p>My goal here is not to place all of the blame and onus on the teachers and education system of the American state.</p><p>Students are not (or rather, shouldn&#x27;t be) passive observers in their education, and should advocate for themselves when the system fails. But how many of us can say we did such a thing?</p><p>Let me paint you a journey, for those who were not educated in this Great Country of Ours, or perhaps educated in a different era, what The System was like during my schooling:</p><h3 id="it-begins-in-primary-school"><a href="#it-begins-in-primary-school" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>It Begins in Primary School</h3><p>Maths in the early years, for the most part, are no issue.</p><p>Basic additional, multiplication, division, fractions.</p><p>These are intuitive concepts, explained in word problems easily related to the real world, that any layperson could thoroughly describe to a child.</p><p>Save for one incident, which proved to be the rumblings of something worse to come:</p><h4 id="two-apples-less-than-zero"><a href="#two-apples-less-than-zero" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Two Apples Less than Zero</h4><p>I can vividly recollect it to this day.</p><p>It would have been in the 1st or 2nd grade. We were studying the &quot;Number Line&quot;, and basic addition and subtraction.</p><p>The event went something like follows:</p><blockquote><p>Class, if I have 3 apples, and I eat 2 apples, how many do I have left?&quot;</p><p>&quot;One apple, miss!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And if I eat one more, how many?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Zero apples, miss!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>And then, my raised hand:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Miss, what happens if you eat 2 more apples now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...</p></blockquote><p>Silence for a moment, and then:</p><blockquote><p>Nothing. You can&#x27;t eat 2 more apples if you have no apples to eat. You still have 0 apples.</p></blockquote><p>Panic and confusion begin to set in.</p><p>I had devised that when doing addition and subtraction, the resulting number is always different. No operation can possibly result in the same starting number.</p><p>This statement handed down to me by <em>The All-Knowing</em> broke all understanding and reason I had formed about numbers and their operations.</p><p>I was deeply unsettled and left with the feeling that something Wasn&#x27;t Quite Right, but I shoved it down for the time being.</p><p>In hindsight, it&#x27;s perfectly clear that the material was not meant to cover the concept of negative numbers until a much later grade.</p><p>But you can&#x27;t tell a child a lie like that out of convenience, especially when they are beginning to form their fundamental models of the mathematical world.</p><h4 id="the-twin-headed-hydra-lattice-multiplication--long-division"><a href="#the-twin-headed-hydra-lattice-multiplication--long-division" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Twin-Headed Hydra: <code>Lattice Multiplication &amp; Long Division</code></h4><p>Towards the end of primary (Elementary) school, the dragon begins to rear its head:</p><p>This two-headed Hydra is named <code>Lattice Multiplication &amp; Long Division</code>.</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_multiplication">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_multiplication</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_division">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_division</a></li></ul><p>At this point, to my young brain, my education veers off a cliff into someplace dark and filled with sheer madness.</p><p>The teachers tell us that when working with large, multi-digit multiplication and division problems, we should use these methods.</p><p><em><strong>&quot;You see, you draw some boxes, and then you connect this number with this number, and you...&quot;</strong></em></p><p>WHAT? Magic shapes you draw and a series of incantations that somehow allow you to arrive a correct answer?! This is heresy -- pure and unadulterated lunacy.</p><p>Science and maths were my favorite subjects, they were the study of &quot;Why?&quot;, the fundamental question and logic of the world.</p><p>When I asked my teachers to explain, <em><strong>&quot;Why?&quot;</strong></em>, <em><strong>&quot;How does this work?&quot;</strong></em>, I was told to Be Quiet and that <em><strong>&quot;It just does.&quot;</strong></em></p><p>Eventually, apathy set in. I gave up asking for explanations. I realized that the people instructing me didn&#x27;t know.</p><p>They were just parroting something they themselves had been told. The incantation gives the correct answer, and that was &quot;good enough&quot; for them, No Further Questions Needed.</p><p>To this day, I never did learn how to do the above.</p><p>I had come up with a simple system for handling larger number division and multiplication -- break the numbers down into groups of 10&#x27;s, 5&#x27;s, and 1&#x27;s.</p><p>For example:</p><p><code>237 * 128</code></p><p>Would be:</p><p><code>237 * 100</code> + <code>(237 * 10) * 2</code> + <code>(237 * 10) / 2</code> + <code>(237 * 1) * 3</code></p><p>For small numbers I could do it in my head, and for +4 digits I would do it on paper.</p><p>Good Enough for Me.</p><h3 id="my-fate-is-sealed-in-middle-school"><a href="#my-fate-is-sealed-in-middle-school" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>My Fate is Sealed in Middle School</h3><p>This pattern continues into my Middle School education (grades 6-8 here).</p><p>Algebra is described in abstract terms.</p><ul><li>&quot;Y = MX + B&quot;</li><li>&quot;Slope-intercept formula&quot;</li><li>&quot;The origin point&quot;</li></ul><p>It would have been so easy to teach algebra in terms of equations of real-world systems or events.</p><p>In basic geometry, I am fed half-lies like: &quot;The sum of all the angles (interior) of a triangle is 180 degrees&quot;.</p><p>This is not incorrect, but in my mid-20&#x27;s I would discover that Euclidean Geometry is only one of many possible geometries, and students are never even told that &quot;Geometry&quot; in school really means &quot;Euclidean Geometry.&quot;</p><p>I am checked out. I stop doing schoolwork. I barely scrape by and graduate to Highschool.</p><p>The only thing that makes any sense to me intuitively is Statistics.</p><h3 id="i-give-up-in-highschool-and-try-community-college"><a href="#i-give-up-in-highschool-and-try-community-college" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>I Give up in Highschool and try Community College</h3><p>I physically attend Highschool, but don&#x27;t do any regular classwork or homework.</p><p>I only do the tests, which in my school were weighted for 70% of your grade. That seems like the optimal effort-to-reward ratio.</p><p>In classes I find interesting, I sometimes engage with the content, in other classes I just sit at the back of the class and fall asleep on my desk.</p><p>At this time in my life, I thought I wanted to be an Organic Chemist. More than half of my courses seem woefully irrelevant and a waste of my time.</p><p>So I do what seems to be the logical thing, and I get my GED, get a job, and off to College I go.</p><p>The first Algebra course in Community College is much harder than the ones in middle and high school.</p><p>None of it makes any sense to me, and I&#x27;m severely lacking fundamentals from other domains.</p><p>I struggle for 6 weeks before I withdraw from the course, and decide that college isn&#x27;t for me.</p><p>I&#x27;m exhausted from working 8 hours a day out in the sun and then going to class at night. I&#x27;ll just figure something else out.</p><h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I don&#x27;t know exactly why I wrote this.</p><p>I think partly, it might have been carthatic for me.</p><p>Maybe there are other people on the internet who had similar experiences, and will read this and go: &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m not the only one!&quot;</p><p>I&#x27;m sure there are excellent educators out there who manage to teach and relate maths in a way that truly connects with their students.</p><p>Unfortunately, I had no such luck to encounter one.</p><p>If maths education continues this way in the USA, I don&#x27;t have high hopes for our future.</p><h2 id="post-script"><a href="#post-script" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Post-script</h2><p>In hindsight, I would&#x27;ve done things differently.</p><p>I didn&#x27;t realize how expensive education was in America.</p><p>I would&#x27;ve done the bare minimum to pass the Humanities courses, and tried to get the most out of my STEM courses.</p><p>I would&#x27;ve participated in extra-curriculars.</p><p>But, making Stupid Mistakes like this are the hallmark of youth.
