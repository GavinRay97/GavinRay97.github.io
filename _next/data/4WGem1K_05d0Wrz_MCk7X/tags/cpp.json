In this blog post, we'll be exploring the development of a GCC plugin that adds support for [[invariant]] conditions in C++ classes and structs. We'll also be looking at an example of how invariant can be used to improve the integrity of a Stack data structure. This is especially timely as GCC has recently added support for Contracts, allowing you to annotate functions with pre/post conditions. Don't miss out on learning how to use this powerful feature in your own projects!\n","images":["/static/images/design-by-contract-logo.png"],"slug":"adding-invariant-to-cpp-design-by-contract"}],"tag":"cpp"},"__N_SSG":true}
