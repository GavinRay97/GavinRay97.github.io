In this blog post, we'll be exploring the development of a GCC plugin that adds support for [[invariant]] conditions in C++ classes and structs. We'll also be looking at an example of how invariant can be used to improve the integrity of a Stack data structure. This is especially timely as GCC has recently added support for Contracts, allowing you to annotate functions with pre/post conditions. Don't miss out on learning how to use this powerful feature in your own projects!\n","images":["/static/images/design-by-contract-logo.png"],"slug":"adding-invariant-to-cpp-design-by-contract"},{"title":"A Day Without a Copilot: Reflections on Copilot-Driven Development","date":"2022-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["github-copilot","machine-learning","non-technical"],"draft":false,"summary":"A reflection on the impact of language models like Github Copilot on the experience on authoring software and the role of the developer","images":["https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b22c603c99f2733ff060b01d4b184a2504e3f4b089cd8a8b113884f7b85a4782/68747470733a2f2f7265732e636c6f7564696e6172792e636f6d2f70726163746963616c6465762f696d6167652f66657463682f732d2d70454d3650587a582d2d2f635f696d616767615f7363616c652c665f6175746f2c666c5f70726f67726573736976652c685f3432302c715f6175746f2c775f313030302f68747470733a2f2f6465762d746f2d75706c6f6164732e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f75706c6f6164732f61727469636c65732f36336d347072357a6e7a667172716c776e33396b2e706e67"],"slug":"a-day-without-a-copilot"},{"title":"Building a high-performance database buffer pool in Zig using io_uring's new fixed-buffer mode","date":"2022-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["database","zig","io_uring","performance","linux"],"draft":false,"summary":"In this post, we will explore how to build a high-performance database buffer pool in Zig using io_uring's new fixed-buffer mode.","images":["/static/images/io_uring_zig_logo.png"],"slug":"io-uring-fixed-bufferpool-zig"},{"title":"Panama: Not-so-Foreign Memory.
