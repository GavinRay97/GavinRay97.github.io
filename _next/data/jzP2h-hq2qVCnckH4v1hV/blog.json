In this blog post, we'll be exploring the development of a GCC plugin that adds support for [[invariant]] conditions in C++ classes and structs. We'll also be looking at an example of how invariant can be used to improve the integrity of a Stack data structure. This is especially timely as GCC has recently added support for Contracts, allowing you to annotate functions with pre/post conditions.
